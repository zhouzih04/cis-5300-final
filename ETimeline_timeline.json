The report said that when this warning was issued, Scholz had already begun a three-day trip to China. Scholz arrived in Chongqing by plane on the morning of the 14th to begin an official visit to China. The report first explained that the main purpose of Scholz's trip was to strengthen the relationship between Germany and its biggest trading partner, China, and resolve differences between China and Germany in areas such as trade and the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. The report went on to say, however, that Iran's attack on Israel “seems to be redefining” the original agenda and tone of Scholz's current visit. Reuters quoted German government sources as saying that during flights to Chongqing, Scholz has been watching the latest developments in the Middle East region. The source also said that the German delegation to China has also always maintained close ties with the German security services. The report mentioned that Scholz told reporters, “We will do everything we can to stop the situation from escalating further.” “We can only warn everyone, especially Iran, not to continue doing this.” One of his spokespersons said that Scholz condemned Iran's attack on Israel “in the strongest terms” after arriving in China. A source from the German delegation to China also revealed earlier that Scholz will also be staying at a hotel to attend a video conference with G7 leaders to discuss Iran's attack on Israel.",
